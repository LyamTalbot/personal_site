I'm a software developer based in Australia, recently graduated with a Bachelor of Computer Science from the University of New England.\
I didn't start in tech, several years ago a serious injury pulled me out of physical work for a long stretch, during that time I started an Udemy course on web development to keep myself occupied.
It turned out to be the best thing that could have happened. I discovered that I enjoyed the logic, problem solving and the sense of building something. This pushed me into studying computer science properly and I began my bachelor's degree the same year\
\
I'm the kind of developer who learns by doing. I like to take a steady, thoughtful approach to problems and I try to solve things by reasoning the out before reaching for a search bar. I value clear communication, clean design, and making life easier for the people I work with. I care about reliability, clarity and building things that have a positive impact on people.
\
Right now I'm focussed on growing as a developer and contributing to teams where patience, clear thinking and good communication matter. I like projects that challenge how I think and give me room to make things a little better than I found them.

Links to my Github and a copy of my CV are available on the main page.\
